				<b>Welcome to Untitled Space Craft!</b><br>
				<br>
				If you're reading this, you probably came here from Matt Lowne's YouTube channel or other media where he showcases the controller that he has commissioned from me. If you aren't already, you should subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MattLowne">his channel</a>! Space Chip has also made videos using a controller that he purchased from me. You can subscribe to his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Space_Chip">here</a>!
				I also recommend you check out and subscribe to the Kerbal Controllers subreddit, r/KerbalControllers, to view some of the great builds happening there! If you're interested in building a Kerbal Controller entirely from scratch, you can read <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Kerbal-Controller-the-Basics/">my and Rogor's award-winning Instructable</a>.<br>
				<br>
				<b>About USC</b><br>
				<br>
				Untitled Space Craft is a fully modular controller system for playing Kerbal Space Program. It is designed to supplement or fully replace the keyboard as a means of playing the game, instead allowing you to use various buttons, switches, joysticks, levers, dials, and key locks to pilot your space craft. It also includes LEDs and display readouts to provide information that may not even be readily available in the vanilla game. The controls are punchy and intuitive, leading to a much more immersive gameplay experience.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Containers and Modules</b><br>
				<br>
				USC controllers are separated into containers and modules. Containers come in eight different sizes and are designed to magnetically hold a set number of modules. They include a USB port to connect directly to your PC and are pre-loaded with code for running all of the modules. Modules fit into the containers and hold all of the inputs and displays of the controller. The 24 unique modules can be organized, swapped, and run separately in any configuration of your choosing. Please note that some configurations currently will only work on Windows, though this will change in the future. Multiple containers can also be magnetically joined together to create a larger controller, though each one will need its own USB cable.<br>
				<br>
				Please feel free to request a container size or module that is not in the catalog. I can't guarantee I'll be able to offer it, but I'm always interested in expanding the catalog to suit demand.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Things to Consider</b><br>
				<br>
				Since this is not a massive operation, I cannot say I have tested these devices on every setup. So far nobody has failed to get them running on their machine. However, I have noticed that the controllers are less stable when using a USB hub to connect them to the PC. Given all of the variables that a USB hub may add to the system, it is recommended that you only get as many containers as you have available USB ports on your PC.<br>
				<br>
				I also cannot guarantee that the controllers will work with every mod setup. I myself play with a very extensive mod folder, and I suffer no stability or compatibility issues with the controllers. They seem to work well with major autopilot mods, but conflicts may occur that I cannot forsee.<br>
				<br>
				There are also two mods required for certain modules. Action Groups Extended is required for Action Groups modules that go above 10, and Alternate Resource Panel for Telemetry and EVA fuel displays. The Action Groups above 10 might not behave the same as the stock KSP action groups, particularly when changing between ships.<br>
				<br>
				<b>KSP2 and Other Games</b><br>
				<br>
				USC controllers have two modes of operation. They function with direct communication with both KSP1 and KSP2, meaning the controller calls functions directly in the game and can receive info back, such as telemetry. Currently in Beta, they can also function as simple keyboard and joystick emulators. Joystick emulation is dependent on each game, but there is also an option to use the joysticks as digital inputs via keyboard emulation. This can be accessed in the settings file for the controller but requires flashing new code to the board. A guide with step-by-step instructions is included with each controller.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Kits, DIY Options, and Customization</b><br>
				<br>
				I offer kits for a reduced price. The modules each are 40% off the listed price, though the containers continue to be the same price. Please note that this is only recommended for those with soldering experience. While a guide is provided, the construction process can be fairly unforgiving if you don't pay attention to detail, though the soldering is technically easy and entirely through-hole. This option is taken entirely at your own risk and non-refundable. I will happily ship replacement parts at cost and offer advice, but you must be able to fix mistakes and proceed with care.<br>
				<br>
				If you wish to design your own container to add USC modules into, I am willing to provide the necessary dimensions and magnets.<br>
				<br>
				The modules themselves can also come in the same colors as the containers. Please note that the lettering might not be as visible on darker colors. There are also some options for changing the button colors, mostly limited to the colors you can already find on other modules.<br>
				<br>
				Currently we do not offer custom code or any structural modifications, including remapping or moving buttons.<br>
				<br>
				<b>About Us</b><br>
				<br>
				USC is based out of Taiwan. It originally was created and managed by Codapop, but production is now run by Bluecoolwolf, with Coda only handling customer service and guidance. Coda also has other projects you may check out or even contribute to: the <a href="https://libraryoftime.xyz/">Library of Time</a>, the <a href="https://randomizer.untitledspacecraft.com/">KSP Tech Tree Randomizer</a>, a mod for KSP called <a href="https://github.com/CodapopKSP/SciencePlus">Science+</a>, and even Untitled Space Craft itself, which is now <a href="https://github.com/CodapopKSP/UntitledSpaceCraft">open source</a>.

			<div id="ordering-guide-wrapper">
				<b>1) How to Order</b><br>
				<br>
				To order you can simply email us or contact Coda on Discord. Please refer to the Contact button on the main page.<br>
				<br>
				After you have finished designing your controller on this website, you can click the 'Engineer's Report' button to check if there are any compatibility issues between the modules. When it has cleared all checks, or if you need some help/advice, click the Save button and paste a link to your build in your email or message. Then confirm that you would like to purchase the order, after which you will be asked to place a 30% deposit.<br>
				<br>
				Check out the Recommended Configurations button for some controller ideas! Keep in mind that some modules currently will only work for Windows. If using Mac or Linux, there are still many configurations that will work, but just contact us first so we can figure out what will work for your operating system.<br>
				<br>
				<b>2) Payment Timeline</b><br>
				<br>
				Prior to starting your build, we require a 30% non-refundable deposit on the final bill. This is because USC controllers are built-to-order, and there may be a waiting list depending on demand. It is unfair to others who are waiting for us to spend time building a controller for a customer who isn't serious about completing their purchase. We will also ask you to confirm which country we will need to ship to before starting.<br>
				<br>
				The build process takes several weeks to a few months, after which we will send you photos of the completed modules if you require them. Then we will package the controller and weigh the package for shipping to determine the shipping costs. Prior to shipping, the full payment is required.<br>
				<br>
				<b>3) Payment Method</b><br>
				<br>
				Untitled Space Craft is based in Taiwan but receives payments via a USD PayPal account. If you'd like to use a different currency, please ensure the proper amount is received in USD after conversion fees.<br>
				<br>
				Please choose the goods/services option and add 4.5% to the final bill to cover the PayPal fees.<br>
				<br>
				If you don't have Paypal, then we can find an alternative method, such as a direct bank transfer.<br>
				<br>
				<b>4) Quality and Warranty</b><br>
				<br>
				Once the controller arrives, we will honor a 6 month warranty on all parts. This does not include damage that you may have caused the controller. So if the controller arrives and doesn't work for some reason, or it has been damaged in shipping, then we will send you replacement parts entirely free of charge. If the controller stops working within 6 months, we will replace offending modules free of charge. However, if the package is visibly damaged when it arrives, then you must get a damage report from the postman or else this warranty is void.<br>
				<br>
				After 6 months and for as long as we still have this project, we will repair broken/malfunctioning modules/containers for free, though you will have to pay for the shipping and necessary materials. In general we expect the controllers to be pretty hardy, as none of the parts are too electrically sensitive, and we've taken great care to make them as stable as possible (at the expense of a lot of prototyping).<br>
				<br>
				The controllers are built with lead-free solder and should be completely safe to handle, though we still recommend washing your hands after touching the bottoms of any modules. Just be careful not to break any of the wires on the bottoms of the modules!<br>
				<br>
				<b>5) Shipping</b><br>
				<br>
				From Taiwan to the USA, shipping costs roughly $10-15 per module and takes about 1-2 weeks, though the exact cost is dependent on size and weight, which is different for each controller. So an 8 module controller will cost about $110, and 4 modules will cost about $50. Shipping costs are confirmed prior to shipping and prior to final payment. Other countries will have different rates and shipping times. From Taiwan we can ship to a number of different countries, but if you don't live in one of these countries, then we can try to find another method, such as sending the controller to a relative of ours or yours in a country that can ship to both.<br>
				<br>
				Here's a <a href="https://www.post.gov.tw/post/FileCenter/post_ww2/post_docdata_att/att_content/81A4FA7B-39E8-428B-8844-67E82F8FD3C8/D0493E22-E09D-4D4C-B0D0-4D6AF56F1B82.jpg">list of countries</a> that we can ship directly to.<br>
				<br>
				<b>6) After Shipping</b><br>
				<br>
				The controller will arrive in a deconstructed state. The modules will be separated and the container pieces will be bundled together. You will need to fit the container pieces together like a puzzle and glue them using silicone caulk from your local hardware store (like the stuff you seal up gaps in your bathroom with, preferably the same color as your container or clear). Assembly is pretty straightforward and should take less than an hour. We will send you a set of instruction manuals prior to arrival of the package.<br>
				<br>
				The modules can then fit into any slot in the container and can be plugged in any way you like. The plugs are all standard and interchangeable, so there's no way to screw it up. The controller then will plug in via the provided USB cable and DC 5V wall adapter (100v-240v).<br>
				<br>
				After that, you will need to follow the setup instructions in the manual, which include downloading the Simpit mod, locating the USB port that your controller uses, and editing the Simpit config file in your GameData folder to reflect that number. After that it's plug and play!
